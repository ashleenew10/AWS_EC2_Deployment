# CHLA No-Show Predictor â€“ AWS EC2 Streamlit Deployment

This project is a deployed machine learning application that predicts patient no-shows at CHLA clinics using appointment data. The app is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and built with Streamlit for an interactive frontend.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Streamlit 1.32.0
- scikit-learn 1.4.2
- pandas 2.2.2
- numpy 1.26.4
- joblib 1.4.2
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)
